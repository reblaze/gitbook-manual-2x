# Ban, Unban, and Whitelist Traffic Sources

The [Quarantine](../security/quarantined.md) section shows a list of traffic sources \(i.e., sources of incoming requests\) that are currently banned, blacklisted, and whitelisted. 

## How to ban a requestor

A traffic source is banned automatically when it violates a [Dynamic Rule](../security/dynamic-rules.md). You cannot manually ban a requestor.

However, you can accomplish the same effect by blacklisting the requestor. [Instructions are here](../security/quarantined.md#blacklist-and-whitelist).

## How to unban a requestor

You can manually remove a requestor from the Banlist or Blacklist. [Instructions are here](../security/quarantined.md#manual-removal).

## How to whitelist a requestor

Whitelisting a traffic source will make it exempt from Dynamic Rules. [Instructions are here](../security/quarantined.md#blacklist-and-whitelist).
