# Settings

The Settings section has an extensive number of configuration values for Reblaze. These tend to be parameters that once set up, usually will not change during your use of Reblaze.

There are five sections in this part of the interface.

[Web Proxy ](web-proxy/)contains parameters for the overall architecture of Reblaze and its interaction with the downstream clients and the upstream network. It includes settings for proxy behavior, load balancing, failover, and more. It is also where you assign Security Profiles to specific areas of your website.

[SSL Management](ssl-management.md) is where SSL Certificates are uploaded and managed.

[DNS](dns.md) is where DNS records are configured.

[Planet Overview](planet-overview.md) shows you information relevant to your entire planet: the active domains and applications, what notifications are issued in response to events, and the ability to Publish changes that were made elsewhere in the interface.

[Account](account.md) is where your user account settings are managed.
