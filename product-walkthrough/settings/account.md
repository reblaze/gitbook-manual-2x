# Account

The Account Settings allows you to review and modify your Reblaze user account. 

From this page, you can reset your password. Before this can be accomplished, you will need to enter an OTP \(One Time Password\) code that will be sent to you via SMS text message.

Alternatively, you can scan the QR code shown on this page, using an app like Google Authenticator \(available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) and [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/il/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)\). 

This will generate an OTP without requiring you to wait for an SMS message.
