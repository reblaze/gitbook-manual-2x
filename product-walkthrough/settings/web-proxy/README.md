# Web Proxy

When you deploy Reblaze to protect your web assets, it acts as a proxy, receiving requests from clients \(web visitors, mobile/native app users, etc.\), blocking hostile traffic, and passing legitimate requests to your servers.

The Web Proxy section defines how Reblaze behaves in this role. It consists of three tabs: 

* [General Settings](web-proxy-general-settings.md)
* [Application Profiles](application-profiles.md)
* [Security Profiles](security-profiles.md)

Proxy settings are configured per site/application. To switch between them, click on the drop down menu on the right side.
