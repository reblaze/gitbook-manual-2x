# Traffic

The Traffic section allows you to monitor your network activity on a monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, or even minute-by-minute basis. It contains two primary sections: the Dashboard and View Log. 

\*\*\*\*[**Dashboard**](dashboard.md)**:** Provides an overview and a breakdown of your traffic to the VPC, during specified time frames. In addition, the Dashboard also provides information about Top Activities \(a sorted summary of your top events\). 

\*\*\*\*[**View Log**](view-log.md)**:** Provides the ability to view and query network traffic data. You can analyze and monitor traffic data in real time, or over custom time frames. 

Before diving into the interface, it's helpful to first read [Traffic Concepts: How Reblaze reports on the requests it receives.](traffic-concepts.md)
