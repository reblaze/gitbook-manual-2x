# Profiles

Within the Security section, this tab provides an interface for administering Profiles.

![Profiles Section](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_lmiM6Tpoa4VYrsJfgiaGh3GWAKX0WLxhu9xBmyOTHSufaJrZUg8Vj0xJfLMV22pEhQbZdUBs3Re3003EJxeEj_TkNCDlSeWnRr2R1nZPfmx-p4BzdOy2UPrilQOmtyOSQvq9SAZ)

Existing Profiles are shown on the left. 

To create a profile, click the Create New button toward the top of the screen, and then choose Profile. Or select an existing one and choose Duplicate, then edit the newly-created copy.

To edit a profile, select it from the list on the left. Its contents will appear in the middle part of the screen. 

To add a new Policy, select the desired Policy from the Link More Policies list on the right, and click the Add button. To remove an existing Policy from the Profile, click on the X to the right of its name.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that every Profile **must include one, and only one,** [WAF/IPS Policy](waf-ips-policies.md).
{% endhint %}

Most Profile administration will not be possible until the appropriate Policies have been created. Similarly, complete Policy administration will not be possible until there are Rules to add to them.
