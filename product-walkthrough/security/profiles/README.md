# Profiles

In a typical deployment, Reblaze performs much of its traffic evaluation according to security Profiles.

Within the Reblaze user interface, there are four sections for defining Profiles: 

1. [Profiles](security-profile-setup.md)
2. [ACL Policies](acl-policies.md)
3. [WAF/IPS Policies](waf-ips-policies.md)
4. [Custom Signature](custom-signature.md)

Before discussing each tab, it will be useful to discuss [Profile Concepts](profile-concepts.md).
